## Overview

## Features

You'll need to install python, and pip before running the pip command.
After installing both, go to your terminal and type/copy paste the command below.

```sh
pip install ion
```


### Setup

Before running Ion, you need to configure your API key and model:

1. **Obtain a Gemini API Key:**

   - Go to [Google AI](https://ai.google.dev) and sign in.
   - Navigate to API Keys and generate a new key.
   - Copy the API key for later use.

2. **Set Up Your Environment File:**

   - Locate the `.env.example` file in the repository.
   - Rename it to `.env`.
   - Open the `.env` file and update it with your API key and model:
     ```sh
     API_KEY=your_google_api_key
     MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
     ```
   - Save the file.

3. **Run the Assistant:**

   ```sh
   ion
   ```

## Usage

Once Ion is running, you can use it to execute commands with natural language input:
